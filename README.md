# Black Friday Sales Prediction

This repository contains code for applying different machine learning models on the Black Friday dataset. The project is built in Python using Sci-kit Learn library and is licensed under the MIT License. We start off by trying different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression and finding the best parameters using random search CV.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about the sales transactions that occurred during Black Friday. It has 12 variables or features including User ID, Product ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category, Stay in Current City Years, Marital Status, Product Category 1, Product Category 2, Product Category 3, and Purchase. The goal of this project is to predict the purchase amount based on the available features.

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* Sci-kit Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

The code can be run using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. To open the notebook, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your default web browser. Open the `Black Friday Sales Prediction.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.
